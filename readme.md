This version of Bibliomancy uses a mysql table and a PHP file to select an LC range and number at random.  

It's very simple. 

You can see it in action at: [http://obliquestrategies.aedileworks.com/bibliomancy.php](http://obliquestrategies.aedileworks.com/bibliomancy.php)  

Because I didn't quite think things through first, I'm collecting passages in another repo:   
[Oblique Strategies Divined] (https://github.com/copystar/bibliomancy/blob/master/oblique_strategies_divined.md)
