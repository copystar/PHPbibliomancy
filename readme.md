This version of Bibliomancy uses a mysql table and a PHP file to select an LC range and number at random.  

Trouble is, I can't get my PHP to connect to mysql table.  My $dbc (database connection) variable spits out "Resource id #3" instead of making the connection as it should.  Any ideas how to fix?
